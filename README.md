**Ọpọlọ**
==========
implemented with Kivy and Python

Kivy
----
This program is based on the Kivy engine - http://kivy.org.
You need a running installation to use it on your PC. The installation guide can be found under http://kivy.org/docs/installation/installation.html.

The game
--------
You are playing a orange-blue frog, which wants to come to the other side of the pond. For that, it has to catch flys, jump on water lilys and buttons and do different exercises. But he isn't the only one on the lake. Other frogs are blocking his way. They must be jumped to clear the way.

The name of the game
--------------------
Ọpọlọ is the word for frog in yoruba (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_language). We liked the sound so we took it.

Credits
-------
* All sounds are made by me (Valentin Pratz) and Peter Koppatz.
* The images are mostly self made with Blender (http://blender.org). The models can be found in the models/ folder

Technical information
---------------------
The game is designed to run on all sizes of devices, but the performance on Android is very worse. (Download: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.vocaword.frogs). Maybe in new versions the problem will get fixed.
